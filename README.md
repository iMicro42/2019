Hey,

Its Micro/Moe.

These are all the programs that I worked on throughout 2019.

Yes, their pretty bad so HELP ME!!

-------------------------------------

What's included w/short desc.

ceaserCipherEncrypter/Decrypter.py - I started learning about encryption around 9/20/2019, and I really enjoyed it.
So, I decided to make a massively outdated encrypter. It was bad...

playfair2.py - As a follow up to my first "AMAZING" "UNBREAKABLE" encryption software, I made a slightly better version of a slightly less outdated encrypter. Basically, instead of using a 5x5 alphabet square, I used a 6x6 alphanumeric square. Check it out, if you like!

PasswordGenerator.py - Just a password generator that uses 66 different characters and random function. I often use this with my outdated Encryptor...

color.c nearest.c pensPencils.py - Codeforces problems.

ordinal.c - School assignment.

-------------------------------------

That's all folks!
